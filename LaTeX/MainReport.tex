\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%The introduction should motivate the work that is described, set it in a wider context and explain why it is important or interesting. The introduction should be relatively accessible and inspire the reader to read on. The main result may be mentioned as part of this process, but repeating the results of the investigation is not the main function of the introduction.

Jupiter's aurora has been a mystery ever since 1979, when voyager 1 made a fly-by through the Jovian system. Ever since then the features of the bright auroras of Jupiter invigorated curiosity on such similar yet bizarre aurora patterns its poles. 

We are able to observe the aurora oval of Jupiter to be significantly large as well as having periodic variations of brighter UV intensity within dark areas of Jupiter's aurora oval. There are also other features absent on earth, particularly the satellite footprint of the aurora, where the moons of jupiter creates the phenomenon from it's effect on jupiter's mangetic field.

\section{\TODO[Background]}
\label{sec:background}

Jupiter's aurora observed as particular features, notably four distinct patterns: the aurora oval, satellite tail, dark region of the aurora and .....

Jupiter's aurora can be divided into four distinct emission regions; the main oval emissions, satellite-induced footprint emissions, high-latitude poleward (polar) emissions, and the low-latitude emissions. The main oval houses the polar emissions, orbited by the satellite footprint emissions. Low-latitude emissions are positioned between the main oval and the orbital path traced out by satellite emissions.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
We captured 20 sets of $100$s exposures from the \ac{STIS} onboard the \ac{HST}. The data was captured through the F25SRF2 filter, which allows \ac{FUV} wavelengths in the range of 700-1800\AA. Observations were made over the course of 22 days from \ac{DOYs} 137-159 in 2016. The exposures focus on the northern aurora of Jupiter taking the intensity from counts and converting to kR using the method developed by \cite{Counts-kR-GUSTIN}.


\section{\TODO[Methodology]}
\label{sec:method}

For modeling the aurora, we will take \ac{HST} data that contain several fit files, which contain the aurora data for a snap shot of the jupiter. Using python we will be able to create code and functions to take raw data from \ac{HST} into a timelapse of the aurora. 

in far UV, and with intensity over the spectrum, it will be a polar graph of the aurora oval, on the dayside where it is the most visible.

We will be importing multiple Python packages and library in order to utilize the.fit files from the Hubble space telescope of Jupiter's auroras. We will create our own programming file to retrieve the \ac{HST} data and project it, which can be found in the files. 

We will be creating a looping function in order to take the fit files for each Hubble space telescope dataset to compile them into a gif to present the variation of the aurora. The polar coordinates of the graph will be with \ac{CML} akin to the prime median on earth.

System-3 coordinates is the coordinate system used by the HST and the JUNO missions to parametrise a full rotation of Jupiter. System-1 and system-2 coordinates classifies one rotation of Jupiter by atmospheric motion near the equator and polewards respectively. This is not a true representation of the planet's rotation as the atmosphere rotates faster than the planet, with
