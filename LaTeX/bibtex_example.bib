This is a BibTeX file.

If you are sourcing BibTeX citations from the publications directly, 
most journal websites (and even some textbook publishers) will have
a way that you can generate the BibTeX for copy-paste. This is a
format everyone has agreed upon and wants you to use, so they try to
make it reasonably easy.

If you are copy-pasting BibTeX below either from the publication itself
or from a reputable platform like ADS, it should be correctly formatted
such that your bibliography will end up being correctly formatted once 
compiled. For example, the first entry below has a lot of co-authors, but
the template we are using knows that it should truncate these to "et al."
in the actual bibliography, and you don't have to worry about it. Most of
the time, you should not need to manually edit a BibTeX entry.

Note that BibTeX ignores anything outside of the actual citations
so you can use the rest of the text file to annotate what each paper is
and make it easy to visually scan when scrolling quickly through.

This file has references in alphabetical order, which is helpful for finding things later.
